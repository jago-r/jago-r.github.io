    <h1>Jago Rowe</h1>
    <p>I am Jago (/d͡ʒeɪgoʊ/ or /d͡ʒagɔ/, or any other pronounciation you can think of), a final year Undergraduate Linguistics Student at University of Cambridge. I am interested in natural and constructed languages from a variety of perspectives, primarily relating to to morphosyntax and typology, but also with an interest in phonetics, historical linguistics and computational linguistics.</p>

<p>My research so far has primarily been concerned with cognition and how this shapes language categories and the orders which they can appear in. I have worked on the Final-over-Final condition, an attested linearisation restriction which bans a head-final phrase from dominating a head-initial one under certain (poorly defined) conditions. I am particularly interested in the prosodic correlations of this, and how we might be able to model this computationally. In my work, I take inspiration from computer science and mathematics, while mixing this with linguistic coverage.</p>

<p>I mainly work with the Indo-European language family, although for work in language prosody I work with Chinese varieties. I am enthusiastic about the Cornish language (that's where my name comes from!), and I am involved with the revived Late Cornish community. I am also passionate about approaching linguistic study from a multimodal perspective, particularly paying attention to signed languages. I am committed to helping coordination between Undergraduate Linguists in the UK and abroad.</p>
